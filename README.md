Hi, I'm Arda.

I'm a Computer Engineering student building backend-focused web projects.
I enjoy working with Python and Flask, and lately I’ve been experimenting with AI and NLP systems.

I care about clean code, simple architectures, and building things that actually work.

Tech:
Python, C++, Flask, FastAPI, React, REST APIs
